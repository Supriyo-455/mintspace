[Important]:
    - Move to gin.
    - Create error page for displaying the errors
    - remove secret from jwtAuth.go to a hidden file
    - Seperate mysql test database and prod database
    - Right now we are storing the blogs in a particular folder which will change in the future.
        The blog creation request struct stores blog content, Image url, title which we can store inside the database,
        so we need to update the blog fetching mechanism again from file based to database based.
        - Remove blogs folder, update all the dependencies of blogs folder to fetch blogs from mongo database.
        - Create detailed blog request which will have the followings
            - Author
            - Premium status
            - Date of creation
        - Store blog with this informations
    - Get user data struct when required

    - Session based authentication for user
        -ref: https://dev.to/theghostmac/understanding-and-building-authentication-sessions-in-golang-1c9k 
    - MVC architecture
    - Create a mechanism to create appropiate markdown file when creating blogs
    - Use Bluemonday for sanitizing unsafeHTML (XSS Attack prevention)
    - Singleton pattern and error handling for mongo database
    - Admin page
    - Form validations in blog writting page
    - Improve variable scanning inside mysql_storage.go to be more compact
    


[Future upgrades]:
    - Dockerise the project
    - Cache the parsed markdown file result (Use redis or memcache)


[Current Status]:
    Working but blogs and accounts are not yet linked, also blog need to be stored inside db.

    - Login page not showing. (FIX THIS) Date: 04-10-2023
    - Close database connection after closing the app
    - User created by the test function not showing inside database but the test is passing? (FIX THIS)
    - Redirect signup page to login page after successful user creation.
    - User password encryption using bcrypt
