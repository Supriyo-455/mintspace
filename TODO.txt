[Important]:
    - Right now we are storing the blogs in a particular folder which will change in the future.
        The blog creation request struct stores blog content, Image url, title which we can store inside the database,
        so we need to update the blog fetching mechanism again from file based to database based.
        - Remove blogs folder, update all the dependencies of blogs folder to fetch blogs from mongo database.
        - Create detailed blog request which will have the followings
            - Author
            - Premium status
            - Date of creation
        - Store blog with this informations
    - User password encryption using bcrypt

    - Get user data struct when required

    - Session based authentication for user

    - MVC architecture
    - Create a mechanism to create appropiate markdown file when creating blogs
    - Use Bluemonday for sanitizing unsafeHTML (XSS Attack prevention)
    - Remove SampleDB functions
    - Seperate mongo test database and production database
    - Singleton pattern and error handling for mongo database
    - Admin page
    - Form validations in blog writting page
    - Remove sampleDb and sampleDbfuncs


[Future upgrades]:
    - Dockerise the project
    - Cache the parsed markdown file result (Use redis or memcache)
